/****h* Galaxy/ARE
 * NAME
 *   ARE - automatic registration engine
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   are <game name> <player limit> <total planet size>
 *       <maximum planet size> <max. number of planets> 
 *            <  <email> 
 * FUNCTION
 *   Automate the registration process for a game.
 *   The program processes email send in by players wishing to join
 *   a particular game. 
 *
 *   In addition players can specify their home planet sizes
 *   by including the line: 
 *
 *    #PLANETS <size of planet 1> <size of planet 2> ... <size of planet n>
 *  
 *   in the body of their email.
 *
 * INPUTS
 *   game name              --  
 *   player limit           -- maximum number of players that can enroll.
 *   total planet size      -- limit on the sum of all planet sizes.
 *   maximum planet size    -- limit on the size of each planet.
 *   max. number of planets -- limit on the number of planet that can 
 *                             be specified.
 *   email                  -- that what formail generates.
 * RESULTS
 *   A confirmation message is send to the players.
 *   Three kind of messages can be generated:
 *   (1)  You are accepted.
 *   (2)  The game is full.
 *   (3)  You made an error in your #PLANETS line.
 *
 *   The email address and planet sizes are written to two files:
 *   (1) $GALAXYHOME/<game name>.players  for players that were accepted
 *   (2) $GALAXYHOME/<game name>.standby  for players that were rejected.
 *   The contents of these files can be pasted into your .glx file.
 *   $GALAXYHOME is either the value you gave it, or if it is undefined, 
 *   $HOME/Games.
 *
 *
 *   The programs does the following checks on the #PLANETS line
 *   (1) Whether the size of a single planet exceeds the limit set.
 *   (2) Whether too many planets are specified.
 *   (3) Whether the sum of all sizes exceeds the limit set.
 *   (4) Whether the sum of all sizes is too small. This will be most
 *       likely be because the player made an error. If this error then
 *       shows up in the turn 0 the player is most likely to drop out.
 *
 *   If any of these errors occur the player is notified and has
 *   to retransmit the enroll request.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *
 *   The entry in the .procmailrc file to accept 25 players for the
 *   game Jangi.  Players can specify a maximum of 5 planets, of which
 *   the total size should now exceed 2000.0. Each single planet
 *   should be no larger that 1000.0
 *
 *     GALAXYNGHOME=$HOME/Games
 *
 *     :0 rw :jangi.lock
 *     * ^Subject.*Join Jangi
 *     |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s    {continued on the next line}
 *          $GALAXYNGHOME/are Jangi 25 2000 1000 5 | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t 
 *
 *   This assumes the program is installed in $GALAXYNGHOME
 *
 *   Players can now enroll in the game sending you an email with 
 *   the subject:
 *
 *      "Join Jangi"

/****f* ARE/getstr 
 *
 * NAME 
 *   getstr -- extract a word from a longer string 
 * SYNOPSIS 
 *   char *getstr(char *s)
 *   word = getstr(someString)
 * FUNCTION
 *   Extract a word from a string of words.  A word is any things that
 *   is seperated by white spaces or a comma, any string that is
 *   delimited by quotes ("), or or any string delimited by { }.
 *
 *   The function is intended to parse a string word by word. It
 *   should be first called as:
 *
 *     firstword = getstr(myStringOfWords);
 *
 *   This gets the first word from the string pointed to by
 *   myStringOfWords.  Then consecutive calls of
 *
 *     nextword = getstr(NULL);
 *
 *   you get the remaining words.
 *
 *   White spaces inside a quote delimited word are turned into 
 *   underscores.  
 *
 *   In a string a ';' signifies the start of a comment. Any words
 *   after a ';' are not parsed.
 * 
 *   In the non comment part ';' and '<' are removed before the words
 *   are returned.
 *  
 * RESULTS
 *   word = a pointer to a nul terminated string.
 *
 *   Program is aborted if the length of the word is longer than 256,
 *   since then some is most likely trying to crack your system.
 * 
 *   When there are no more words"\0" is returned.
 * NOTES
 *   This function can only work on one string at the time since it
 *   works with a statically allocated buffer.  This function is used
 *   almost every where in the program.
