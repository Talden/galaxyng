/****f* CLI/CMD_template
 * NAME
 *   CMD_template -- Create a template .glx file that the GM can edit.
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   ./galaxyng <name> <number of players>
 * FUNCTION
 *   Creates a template .glx file.
 *   All parameters are given some sensible default values.
 *
 *   The number of players is used to determine the size of the galaxy,
 *   using the following formule
 *      42 * ceil (sqrt(number of players))
 *   For games with very few players this size is sometimes too small.
 * SOURCE

/*
 * NOTE: this function will be changing once the ARE modifications are
 * complete as we'll need to read from the .arerc to set the game
 * parameters.
