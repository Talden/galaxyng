To install the GalaxyNG server use:

  make
  make install

or just

  make install

The install script will create all files necessary to run a game on
your machine. All files will be installed in the directory
$HOME/Games.

The installer will ask you for your email address. It might also ask
you for the location of the sendmail command if it can't find it.

If you want to enable WWW highscore lists, make sure you have a
$(HOME)/public_html or $(HOME)/www directory before you start
installing. (Or edit Games/run_turn afterwards.)

Much more information can be found in the server manual, use netscape
index.html.

After installation you might want to:

(1) edit and copy the procmailrc file to enable automatic
    checking of orders; Copy it to $(HOME)/.procmailrc,
(2) edit the games.crontab file to enable automatic 
    running of games, 
(3) run strip on the executable to save some diskspace.

If you have any questions send them to <rfsber@xs4all.nl>

Have fun,
Frans.
