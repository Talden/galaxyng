To enable the the galaxy map graphic option, edit Source/makefile and
follow the directions there. You will also need to have installed
libgd.a (http://www.boutell.com/gd/), libpng, libz, libjpeg, and
libfreetype (these dependencies are explained one the libgd page.)

This option uses the GD library, see COPYING_GD for details.
This option also uses a free truetype font from Larabie Fonts
(http://larabiefonts.com).

After editing the makefile follow the directions below.

If you run galaxyng by hand for game creation, etc you'll need to be
sure that the environmental variable for locating the TTF file is set:
GDFONTPATH is the variable that needs to be set and the file is in the 
normal galaxyng home directory.

To install the GalaxyNG server use:

  make
  make install

or just

  make install

The install script will create all files necessary to run a game on
your machine. All files will be installed in the directory
$HOME/Games.

The installer will ask you for your email address. It might also ask
you for the location of the sendmail command if it can't find it.

If you want to enable WWW highscore lists, make sure you have a
$(HOME)/public_html or $(HOME)/www directory before you start
installing. (Or edit Games/run_turn afterwards.)

Much more information can be found in the server manual, use netscape
index.html.

After installation you might want to:

(1) edit and copy the procmailrc file to enable automatic
    checking of orders; Copy it to $(HOME)/.procmailrc,
(2) edit the games.crontab file to enable automatic 
    running of games, 
(3) run strip on the executable to save some diskspace.

If you have any questions send them to <rfsber@xs4all.nl>

Have fun,
Frans.
