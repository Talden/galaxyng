How to upgrade your existing games:

==== UPGRADE To release-6.1a =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory. If you
don't want the graphical map then this release is not required as 
there are no other changes.

==== UPGRADE To release-6.1 =================

==== UPGRADE To release-6.0 =================

==== UPGRADE To release-5-1  =================

The turn data files are not compatible!!

=== UPGRADE To release-5-0g  =================

The .galaxyngrc file changed, both the command to zip a file as well
as to mime encode it has been changed.   Best is to do a make install
under some other account and copy the .galaxyngrc file that is created
during the install.


You can also create it by hand, mine looks like this:

# cat $HOME/Games/.galaxyngrc

sendmail {/usr/sbin/sendmail -t }
GMemail gumpu@localhost
encode {/usr/bin/mmencode }
compress { /usr/bin/zip }
savereportcopy

**** FILES THAT ARE OBSOLETE ****

The following files can be removed:
o Games/mail_report           ; The engine directly sends the reports.
o Games/check_orders          ; Orders are read from stdin.
o Games/send_<game name>.sh   ; The engine directly sends the reports.


**** FILES THAT CHANGED ****

You will have to edit the following files, or use the copy
created my "make install"

o .procmailrc
  The rule for auto checking of orders changed from

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Order
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/check_orders

  to

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Order
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/galaxyng -check

  A special line is now needed for "report copy" requests

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Report
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/galaxyng -check

  If you want to allow message relaying between players add,

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Relay
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/galaxyng -relay

  Best is to copy these lines from the procmailrci.new file generated
  by "make install", you might also want to add the additonal rules
  to prevent mail loops.

  You probably also want to update your global.bulletin,
  and example can be found in the Doc/ directory.
  
o Games/run_game

  Now takes an optional additional parameter to specify what turn
  is to be run.  You can copy the run_game.new file generated
  by "make install" over your old run_game file.


***** NEW FILES ********

o Games/.galaxyngrc

  This file is essential, games will not run without it.
  It should contains atleast the following two parameters:

    sendmail {/usr/sbin/sendmail -t }    ; the correct path to sendmail
    GMemail you@youraddress              ; your email address
 
  If you allow compressed reports add:

    mutt /usr/local/bin/mutt             ; this is optional
    encode {/usr/bin/uuencode test }
    compress { /bin/gzip  -c }

  "make install" will create a one for you.
